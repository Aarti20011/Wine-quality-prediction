It's a Quality Prediction which uses supervised Machine Learning to make predictions whether wine has a good quality or bad quality.
Through meticulous analysis of various chemical properties such as acidity, pH levels, and alcohol content, I've employed advanced machine learning techniques to develop predictive models that assess the quality of wines.
Data cleaning, Data pre-processing, Data Visualization, Model Training and Model Prediction are the key fundamentals of this task.
With an impressive accuracy rate of 86%, the model adeptly gauges the wine's quality by analysing the provided features.
Project Overview:
In the wine industry, the quality of a wine is influenced by various factors. This project aims to develop predictive models that can accurately assess the quality of wines based on these factors, ultimately helping winemakers optimize their production processes and consumers make informed choices.

Key Features:
Data Collection: We gather data from various sources.
Feature Engineering: Advanced feature engineering techniques to extract relevant features from the collected data, including acidity levels, alcohol content, pH, residual sugar, and more.
Machine Learning Models: Utilizing a variety of machine learning algorithms such as KNN, SVC. Develop predictive models capable of estimating the quality of wines based on their characteristics.
Model Evaluation: We rigorously evaluate the performance of our models using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, and precision-recall curves to ensure their reliability and accuracy.
Visualization and Interpretation: We provide intuitive visualizations and insights into the factors influencing wine quality, enabling stakeholders to understand the underlying patterns and relationships in the data.
Technologies Utilized:
Python: Core language for data preprocessing, model development, and analysis.
Scikit-learn: Employed for implementing machine learning algorithms and model evaluation.
Pandas and NumPy: Used for data manipulation, cleaning, and transformation.
Matplotlib and Seaborn: Employed for data visualization and exploration.
Result:We have achieved 82.4% accuracy with this dataset using the Random forestÂ Algorithm.
